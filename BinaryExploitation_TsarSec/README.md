### An Oral History of Binary Exploitation Defences
This course entails writing an exploit for the vuln.c program that is intentionally vulnerable to stack buffer overflow. At first, all mitigations are disabled and will each be enabled in iterations which in effect warrant updating the exploit to work around them.

### Tools
- GDB 
- Ghidra
- Pwntools
- ROPGadget

Disable ASLR on host OS
```sh
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

Compile vuln.c with no protections
```sh
gcc vuln.c -o vuln_1 -fno-stack-protector -fcf-protection=none -no-pie -z execstack -Wl,-z,norelro
```

#### Analysis of the memory mapping of the program while it is running.
- run the program
```sh
./vuln_1
```
- attach to the program with gdb
```sh
gdb -p $(pidof vuln_1)
```
- show memory areas in use and their address locations
```
info proc mappings
```
